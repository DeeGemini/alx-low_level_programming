In this project, I will focusing on the Firewall foundamentals. What is it and how it works. I will mainly cover the following:

>> Blocking all incoming traffic
>> Port forwarding

What is Firewall?
- A firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.
- It typically establishes a barrier between a trusted network and an untrusted network, such as the Internet.

By the end of this project I should be able to block all incoming traffic successfully and successfully do port forwarding.
